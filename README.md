# Panic-Button
The script is designed for police faction players. It allows a player to activate a "Panic Button" which sends their location to other in-game police officers. When the location is sent, a blip is created on the map and a notification appears on screen for all police officers. The police can then accept or decline the call. If a police officer accepts the call, the position of the blip is put in waypoint to allow him to go to the scene. The blip remains visible on the map for a while, after which it disappears. The script is configured to work with the ESX framework.
